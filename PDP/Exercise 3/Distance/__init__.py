""" Implement a Distance Pack
Have distance of different objects in different modules like Vector(n dimension points), Complex,
Objects with centroid function, Numbers(Integer,float..), String 

Distance Package

This package contains modules for calculating various types of distances between different objects.

Modules:
- Vector: Calculate distances between n-dimensional points.
- Complex: Calculate the absolute difference between complex numbers.
- Centroid: Calculate the distance between centroids of objects.
- Numbers: Calculate the absolute difference between numbers (integers or floats).
- String: Calculate the Levenshtein distance between strings.
